# Energy Monitor
This Plasma 5 extensions allow you to monitor the current consumption and capacity of the battery (orange = capacity of battery, red = consumption). Extension displays the data graphically. It is possible to set the number of samples per minute (1-60: e.g. 5 = 5x per minute plot values to graph) and time range of displayed data (10 - 600 minute). User can also clear the displayed data. Color of graph automatically changes (green when battery is charging and red for discharging).
